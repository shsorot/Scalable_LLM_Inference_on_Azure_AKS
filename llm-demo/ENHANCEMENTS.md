# Enhancement Summary - P0 Features

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Status:** Implementation Complete - Testing Required

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the P0 features added to the KubeCon NA Booth Demo to better showcase Azure Files capabilities in AI/ML workloads.

---

## P0 Feature #1: Multi-Model Support

### What Changed
- **New Script:** `scripts/preload-multi-models.ps1`
- **Updated:** `scripts/deploy.ps1` - Now uses multi-model preload by default
- **Updated:** `DEMOGUIDE.md` - Added multi-model talking points

### Models Included
| Model | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| phi3.5 | 2.3 GB | Microsoft's latest compact model |
| llama3.1:8b | 4.7 GB | Meta's instruction-tuned model (original) |
| mistral:7b | 4.1 GB | Strong general-purpose model |
| gemma2:2b | 1.6 GB | Google's efficient small model |
| **TOTAL** | **~12.7 GB** | All stored once on Azure Files |

### Demo Value
- **Before:** Single model (llama3.1:8b only)
- **After:** 4 models available instantly
- **Talking Point:** "All models stored once, no duplication, instant availability"

### Usage
```powershell
# During deployment (automatic)
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 -Prefix "demo" -Location "westus2" -HuggingFaceToken "hf_xxx" -AutoApprove

# Standalone (add more models later)
.\scripts\preload-multi-models.ps1 -Namespace "ollama"

# Custom model list
.\scripts\preload-multi-models.ps1 -Models @("llama3.2", "codellama:7b") -Namespace "ollama"
```

### Script Features
- ✅ Skips already-downloaded models (idempotent)
- ✅ Tracks download time per model
- ✅ Shows summary statistics (success/skip/fail counts)
- ✅ Displays storage usage (df -h)
- ✅ Includes demo talking points
- ✅ Parallel-safe (checks before downloading)

---

## P0 Feature #2: Horizontal Scaling Demo

### What Changed
- **New Script:** `scripts/scale-ollama.ps1`
- **Updated:** `DEMOGUIDE.md` - Added interactive scaling section [9:00-10:00]

### Capabilities
- Scale from 1 → N replicas (default: 3)
- Show pod distribution across nodes
- Verify all pods access same models (ReadWriteMany)
- Display load balancer endpoints
- Include demo talking points

### Demo Value
- **Key Benefit:** Demonstrates Azure Files ReadWriteMany in action
- **Talking Point 1:** "No storage duplication - all pods share one volume"
- **Talking Point 2:** "Scale up for peak demand, scale down to save costs"
- **Talking Point 3:** "Zero synchronization overhead - instant model access"

### Usage
```powershell
# Scale to 3 replicas (default)
.\scripts\scale-ollama.ps1

# Scale to 5 replicas with detailed output
.\scripts\scale-ollama.ps1 -Replicas 5 -ShowDetails

# Scale back down to 1
.\scripts\scale-ollama.ps1 -Replicas 1
```

### Script Features
- ✅ Validates current replica count
- ✅ Waits for all pods to be ready (up to 5 minutes)
- ✅ Shows pod distribution across nodes
- ✅ Verifies PVC mount on all pods
- ✅ Displays service endpoints and load balancing
- ✅ Optional detailed view (-ShowDetails)
- ✅ Includes demo talking points
- ✅ Warns if insufficient GPU nodes

### Demo Flow (from DEMOGUIDE.md)
1. **Scale Up:** Run script, watch pods start
2. **Show Distribution:** `kubectl get pods -n ollama -o wide`
3. **Verify Sharing:** Check `ollama list` on all 3 pods
4. **Test Load Balancing:** Send requests to service IP
5. **Scale Down:** Return to 1 replica (optional)

## Testing Checklist

### P0 Feature #1: Multi-Model Support
- [ ] Run fresh deployment with multi-model script
  ```powershell
  .\scripts\deploy.ps1 -Prefix "test01" -Location "westus2" -HuggingFaceToken "hf_xxx" -AutoApprove
  ```
- [ ] Verify all 4 models appear in `ollama list`
- [ ] Check Open-WebUI model selector shows all models
- [ ] Test inference with each model
- [ ] Verify total storage usage (~13GB)
- [ ] Test idempotency (run script again, should skip existing)

### P0 Feature #2: Horizontal Scaling
- [ ] Scale to 3 replicas
  ```powershell
  .\scripts\scale-ollama.ps1 -Replicas 3 -ShowDetails
  ```
- [ ] Verify all 3 pods are Running/Ready
- [ ] Check pod distribution (different nodes if possible)
- [ ] Verify all pods show same models (`ollama list` on each)
- [ ] Test load balancing (multiple requests to service IP)
- [ ] Scale back to 1 replica
- [ ] Verify remaining pod still has all models

## Integration Points

### deploy.ps1 Changes
**Lines 422-452:**
```powershell
Write-StepHeader "Pre-Loading Multiple Models"

$MultiModelScript = Join-Path $ScriptsRoot "preload-multi-models.ps1"
if (Test-Path $MultiModelScript) {
    Write-Info "Running multi-model pre-load script..."
    Write-Info "This will download 4 models (~12.7 GB total):"
    Write-Info "  - phi3.5 (2.3 GB)"
    Write-Info "  - llama3.1:8b (4.7 GB)"
    Write-Info "  - mistral:7b (4.1 GB)"
    Write-Info "  - gemma2:2b (1.6 GB)"
    & $MultiModelScript -Namespace "ollama"
    # ... error handling ...
} else {
    # Fallback to single model (preload-model.ps1)
}
```

**Lines 503-510 (Deployment Summary):**
```powershell
Write-Host "  3. Select from 4 pre-loaded models:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "       - phi3.5 (2.3 GB)" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "       - llama3.1:8b (4.7 GB)" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "       - mistral:7b (4.1 GB)" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "       - gemma2:2b (1.6 GB)" -ForegroundColor Gray
```

### DEMOGUIDE.md Changes
**Section Added: [9:00-10:00] Horizontal Scaling Demo (BONUS)**
- Complete step-by-step scaling walkthrough
- Commands for scaling, verification, load testing
- Talking points for Azure Files ReadWriteMany benefits

**Section Updated: [3:00-5:00] Storage Deep Dive**
- New multi-model listing (4 models vs 1)
- Updated talking points about storage efficiency
- Added model selector demo steps

---

## Production Considerations

### Multi-Model Support
- **Storage:** Each model deployment adds to Azure Files usage (plan accordingly)
- **Downloads:** Model downloads happen serially (10-15 min total for 4 models)
- **Selection:** Choose models based on use case (size vs capability tradeoff)
- **Updates:** Re-run script to add new models without affecting existing ones

### Horizontal Scaling
- **GPU Limits:** Ensure node pool has enough GPU nodes (1 GPU per replica)
- **Costs:** Each replica = 1 GPU node active (scale down when not needed)
- **Readiness:** Allow 2-3 minutes per pod for startup + model loading
- **Storage Class:** Requires ReadWriteMany (Azure Files Standard/Premium)

---

## Next Steps (P1+ Features - Future)

### P1 - Demo Enhancements
- **Quick Health Dashboard:** Real-time pod/storage/GPU status
- **Storage Benchmark:** Read/write/latency tests on Azure Files

### P2 - Production Features

- **Regional Failover:** Multi-region setup with geo-replicated storage

### P3 - Advanced Features
- **Fine-Tuning Pipeline:** Distributed training on AKS + Azure Files
